## Name: RUCRAP_MakeHDF.R
## Program version: R 3.3.0
## Program dependencies: rhdf5;  
## Data dependencies: Extracted RUC/RAP data (text format); MODIS GeoMeta data files; 
## Function File: Functions_RUCRAP_MakeHDF.R
## Author: J.H. Belle
## Purpose: Process RUCRAP text files into daily 24hr files, a Terra file and an Aqua file, each containing 6 fields and spanning the CONUS (defined as: 45, 20, -130, -75. Fields are: rh (median); visibility (median); 10u (median); 10v (median); snow depth (median); precipitation (total*time). For the 24hr files the country is separated into 4 time zones using rough longitude lines and averages/totals are taken over the local 24hr day begininng at midnight(pacific:T=-16-16:Lon=-115--130; mountain:T=-17-17:Lon=-102--115; central:T=-18-18:Lon=-87--102; eastern:T=-19-19:Lon=-75--87. Terra and Aqua files will each contain 14 fields (rh, sp, 10u, 10v, surface cape, surface cin, precipitation rate, snow depth, pbl height, cloudbase height, cloudtop height, visibility, upper cape, and upper cin), and will be matched to either the nearest hourly value or the average of the nearest two hourly values for each granule located in the CONUS as determined from the geometadata file extents, such that a value within +-15 minutes of each overpass is matched or estimated; For locations with multiple possible times, the average of all possibilities will be taken (will iteratively calculate sums and a counter for each location off of a standardized grid and then divide);
